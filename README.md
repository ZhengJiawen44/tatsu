## End to End encryption

All files are end to end encrypted and stored in a aws s3 bucket. the module desgnated for retrieval, and encryption/decryption of files is called "Vault" in the app. you can read more about how I implemented it [here](https://excalidraw.com/#room=8feca98c331feac8d27b,XeidBTw8Bp2qXTVBjf41Yg)
